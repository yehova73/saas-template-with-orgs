      <strong>Effective Date:</strong> July 26, 2026

    <p>
      <strong>Last Updated:</strong> July 26, 2026
    </p>
    <p>
      This Privacy Policy describes how [placeholder title] ("[placeholder title]", "Company", "We", "Us",
      or "Our") processes your information when you use our Chrome Extension,
      Web Application, and associated services (collectively, the "Service").
    </p>
    <p>
      We are committed to protecting your personal information and handling it
      responsibly. By accessing or using [placeholder title] at{" "}
      <Link href="[placeholder url]">[placeholder url]</Link> or via our browser
      extension, you acknowledge the processing practices described in this
      Privacy Policy.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>
      We collect information directly from you, automatically through your
      interaction with our Service, and via third-party authentication
      providers.
    </p>
    <ul style={{ listStyleType: "none", paddingLeft: 0 }}>
      <li>
        <b>A. Data Collected directly and via the Chrome Extension</b>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Workspace & Tab Metadata:</strong> When you freeze or save a
            workspace, [placeholder title] collects the full URLs, page titles, favicons, and
            tab order of your open browser tabs. Tab history for restored or
            suspended sessions is generated automatically to manage your
            workspace states.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>URLs and Embedded Metadata:</strong> When saving workspace
            sessions, [placeholder title] collects the full page URLs you have open. Please
            note that certain web applications embed sensitive parameter data
            directly in URLs (such as document IDs, private share tokens, user
            identifiers, or access keys from platforms like Google Docs, Notion,
            or internal dashboards). [placeholder title] handles these URLs strictly as
            workspace configuration data, but users should avoid intentionally
            saving URLs containing temporary authentication tokens or other
            sensitive credentials.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong> Workspace Content:</strong> For synced accounts, we store
            the content you input into your workspace tools, including the
            Markdown Scratchpad (notes, code snippets, documentation links) and
            Focus Micro-Tasks (checklists and task completion statuses).{" "}
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>
              Chrome Storage API <code>(chrome.storage.local)</code>:
            </strong>{" "}
            For both anonymous and registered users, workspace data, preference
            settings, active tab states, and temporary caches are stored
            strictly on your local machine using Chrome’s{" "}
            <code>chrome.storage.local</code> API. We do not utilize{" "}
            <code>chrome.storage.sync</code> or{" "}
            <code>chrome.storage.session</code>.{" "}
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>B. User Account & Identity Data</b>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Anonymous Accounts:</strong> Free Tier users may utilize
            [placeholder title] without providing an email address or password. In this mode,
            an anonymous identifier is generated to manage local workspace state
            and sync limits.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Claimed & Registered Accounts:</strong> When you create or
            claim an account (to enable cloud syncing across devices or upgrade
            to paid tiers), we collect:
            <ul>
              <li>Email address</li>
              <li>
                Profile information provided by third-party identity providers
                (e.g., name, profile picture, or unique OAuth ID if signing in
                via Google or future OAuth providers such as GitHub)
              </li>
              <li>
                Account credentials managed securely via NextAuth (e.g., hashed
                authentication tokens or Magic Link session tokens).
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>C. Billing & Payment Data</b>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Payments are processed by <strong>Stripe</strong>. When you
            subscribe to a paid tier (Solo Pro or Team/Agency), Stripe collects
            your billing details, such as payment card information, billing
            address, and transaction details.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong> Note:</strong> [placeholder title] does not store or process your raw
            credit card or banking details on our servers. Stripe handles all
            payment processing under its own privacy policy and compliance
            standards.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>D. System, Operational & Diagnostic Data</b>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Hosting & Telemetry:</strong> Our Web Application and API
            infrastructure are hosted on <strong>Vercel</strong>. Vercel
            automatically collects standard network server logs, which may
            include your IP address, browser type, operating system, timestamp,
            and HTTP request headers necessary for service delivery, security
            monitoring, and network performance.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

      We do not use third-party advertising cookies or cross-site behavioral

    <h2>8. Data Storage, Retention, and International Transfers</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Primary Infrastructure & Storage Location:</strong> [placeholder title]'s web
        application, API infrastructure, and primary database services are
        hosted on <strong>Vercel</strong>. Data may be processed in the United
        States and other countries where our service providers operate.{" "}
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>International Data Transfers:</strong> Personal data originating
        from the European Economic Area (EEA) or UK that is transferred to the
        United States is protected using the European Commission’s{" "}
        <strong>Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs)</strong> or equivalent
        lawful transfer mechanisms implemented by our cloud providers (Vercel,
        Stripe, Brevo).{" "}

          <li>
            <strong>Local Extension Data:</strong> Remains stored on your local

            Chrome Extension or manually clear your browser extension storage.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Cloud Workspaces:</strong> Saved workspace metadata,
            Markdown notes, and tasks associated with registered accounts are

            automated removal, or request deletion by emailing{" "}
            <a href="mailto:support@[placeholder domain]">support@[placeholder domain]</a>. Upon
            account deletion, all associated cloud-synced workspaces, notes, and
            user profile records are permanently removed from our active
            databases, except where longer retention is strictly required by
            applicable law (e.g., financial transaction records retained for tax
            compliance via Stripe).

    <h2>9. Account Claiming & Data Linking</h2>
    <p>
      Free Tier users operate with anonymous local accounts. If you choose to
      claim your account by signing in with an email address or OAuth provider:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Your locally cached workspaces will be associated with your newly
        registered user account.
      </li>
      <li>
        This allows your tab states, Markdown scratchpads, and task lists to
        sync securely to our cloud database across different machines and
        browser instances.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>10. Your Choices &amp; Data Control</h2>

      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Account Deletion:</strong> You may permanently delete your
        account and clear all cloud-synced workspaces instantly through your
        in-app Account Settings.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Disable Cloud Sync:</strong> You can choose to use [placeholder title] on the
        Free Tier without creating an account, keeping all workspace data stored
        100% locally on your machine via <code>chrome.storage.local</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Uninstall Extension:</strong> Uninstalling the extension
        generally removes its locally stored data. Users may also clear
        extension data through their browser settings.
      </li>
    </ol>
